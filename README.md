# Java-Practice

A comprehensive collection of daily Java programming practice codes, exercises, and projects documenting my journey in mastering Java development from core concepts to advanced frameworks.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal coding laboratory where I upload daily practice problems, exercises, and experimental Java code. It's a continuous learning project that showcases my progress and understanding of Java programming concepts, from fundamental syntax to enterprise-level development patterns.

## What You'll Find Here

### Core Java Fundamentals
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction
- **Data Types and Variables**: Primitive types, wrapper classes, and variable scoping
- **Control Flow**: Loops, conditional statements, switch expressions, and branching
- **Methods and Constructors**: Method overloading, overriding, and constructor chaining
- **Arrays and Collections**: ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList, and advanced collection operations
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and error management
- **String Manipulation**: String operations, StringBuilder, and text processing

### Advanced Java Concepts
- **Multithreading**: Thread creation, synchronization, concurrent programming, and thread pools
- **File I/O and NIO**: File operations, streams, serialization, and new I/O features
- **Generics**: Type-safe collections, bounded wildcards, and generic methods
- **Lambda Expressions**: Functional programming, method references, and stream operations
- **Stream API**: Functional-style data processing and pipeline operations
- **Annotations**: Built-in and custom annotations, reflection, and metadata processing
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, and other GoF patterns

### Java Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Dependency injection, Spring Boot, and enterprise applications
- **JUnit Testing**: Unit testing, test-driven development, and testing best practices
